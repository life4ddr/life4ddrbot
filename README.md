## What is this?
This is the bot that runs on the discord server and performs various functions. 
The purpose of this application is to announce rank up's, trial scores, and other activities as changes are detected in the database. Additionally, it enables commands to control the backend logic for admins without having to make a manual database change by using commands in the #admin-bot channel.

## Roadmap/Wishlist

### Welcome Messaging
Update the logic so that the bot is listening to relevant channels and sending a welcome message when a new user joins the discord server
### "Role Me" Logic
Allow for a command that manually updates and syncs user roles based on a number of factors. This could include (but not limited to):
- Roles related to a user's LIFE4 rank
- Patreon roles
- Rank Royale or specific event roles
