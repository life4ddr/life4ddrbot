## What is this?
This is the bot that runs on the discord server and performs various functions. 
The purpose of this application is to announce rank up's, trial scores, and other activities as changes are detected in the database. Additionally, it enables commands to control the backend logic for admins without having to make a manual database change by using commands in the #admin-bot channel.

## Roadmap/Wishlist

### Discord mentions
Mention a user in the discord announcement channels if they have a valid discord username

### Auto role assignments
Automatically update a user's discord role if their username matches
